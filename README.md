## 🛡️ Firestore Security Rules

To ensure the application functions correctly, use the following security rules in your Firebase Console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow public read for login (if using username login flow)
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    // Secure expenses
    match /expenses/{expenseId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
